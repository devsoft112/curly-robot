<h1>Eclipse Collections 7.0</h1>
<h2>Eclipse Collections initial release</h2>
<p>Dec 24 2015<p>
<h2>About</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/collections/">Eclipse Collections</a> 
  is a collections framework for Java. It has JDK-compatible 
  List, Set and Map implementations with a rich API, additional types not found 
  in the JDK like Bags, Multimaps and set of utility classes that work with any 
  JDK compatible Collections, Arrays, Maps or Strings. The iteration protocol was 
  inspired by the Smalltalk collection framework. </p>
