____
Using the Eclipse Collections test utilities.
____
Eclipse Collections includes a jar file called *{testutils}* that helps you to write unit tests.

The most important class is *{Verify}*, implemented as an extension of JUnit *{Assert}*. *Verify* provides many collection-specific assertions, such as this one to confirm test that two lists are equal.

****
[source,java]
----
MutableList<Integer> list = Lists.mutable.with(1, 2, 3);
Verify.assertListsEqual(Lists.mutable.with(1, 2, 3), list);


Verify.assertSize(2, customersFromLondon);
//instead of

Assert.assertEquals(2, customersFromLondon.size());
Verify.assertEmpty(Lists.mutable.empty());
Verify.assertNotEmpty(Lists.mutable.with(1));
Verify.assertContains(1, Lists.mutable.with(1));
