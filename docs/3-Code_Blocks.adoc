A _code block_, in Eclipse Collections terms, is a single-abstract-method object that is passed as a parameter to an iteration method.
It is an abstraction that represents the evaluation of each element in the course of iteration.
It helps us to further separate _what_ is being done from _how_ it is done.
This topic enumerates the basic code block types&mdash;the Eclipse Collections interfaces and classes&mdash;and the relevant methods to which they apply.

What we call a "code block" in Eclipse Collections is roughly analogous to a _lambda expression_.
The closest analog to a lambda in Java in versions prior to Java 8 is the _anonymous inner class_.

Here are two examples, one implementing *{Predicate}* using a Java 8+ lambda expression, and the other using an anonymous inner class.

.*select* using a lambda
====
[source,java]
----
MutableList<Person> texans =
  this.people.select( each -> each.getAddress().getState().equals("TX"));
Verify.assertSize(1, texans);
----
====

.*select* using an anonymous inner class
====
[source,java]
----
MutableList<Person> texans = this.people.select(
  new Predicate<Person>()
  {
    public boolean accept(Person each)
    {
      return each.getAddress().getState().equals("TX");
    }
  });
Verify.assertSize(1, texans);
----
====

In each case, if the value of _state_ field for any element in *people* equals "TX" then the *select* method includes that element in the result list, *texans*.

This topic introduces the most commonly-used code blocks and the Eclipse Collections methods that use them.
Along with the code block types described here, the current version of Eclipse Collections offers a full suite of primitive code blocks and corresponding code block factories, such as *{IntFunction}*, *{IntPredicate}*, and *{IntProcedure}*.
These code blocks are used by methods on primitive collections.


[NOTE]
====
*About _parameter_ and _argument_*

These terms are often (if inaccurately) used interchangeably to refer to method or function inputs.
(The usual distinction holds that _parameter_ refers to a formal definition of the input, while argument denotes the actual values.)

For the limited purposes of this guide&mdash;and in particular the scope of this topic&mdash;we use _parameter_ to specify the input to an iteration method, such as *select()*.
These parameters can take the form of a code block, (implementing *Predicate*) which itself is an object with methods.
The input for a code block we'll refer to here as the _argument_ - in this example, the argument is *each* (the "current element" upon each iteration).
====

== Predicate

A *{Predicate}* is a single-argument code block that evaluates an element and returns a boolean value.
Also known as a _discriminator_ or _filter,_ it is used with the filtering methods *select*, *reject*, *detect*, *anySatisfy*, *allSatisfy*, and *count*.

|               |Description                                    |Arguments  |Returns |Used By
|*Predicate*    |Evaluates each element of a collection +
                 (the argument), and returns a boolean value.   |One (T)    |boolean |*select*, *reject*, *detect*, *anySatisfy*, *allSatisfy*, *count*
|*Predicate2*   |Evaluates each element of a collection +
                 (the first argument); the second argument +
                 is a parameter passed into the *Predicate2* +
                 from the calling method.                       |Two (T,P)  |boolean |*selectWith*, *rejectWith*, *detectWith*, *anySatisfyWith*, *allSatisfyWith*, *countWith*
|===

The *accept* method is implemented to indicate the object passed to the method meets the criteria of this *Predicate*.
Here is a *Predicate* implemented in a *select* method as an anonymous inner class:

.Predicate as an anonymous inner class
====
[source,java]
----
MutableList<Integer> greaterThanFifty =
    list.select(new Predicate<Integer>()
    {
        public boolean accept(Integer each)
        {
            return each > 50;
        }
    });
----
====

The *{Predicates}* class can be used to build common filters.
*Predicates* supports equals, not equals, less than, greater than, less than or equal to, greater than or equal to, in, not in, and, or, and numerous other predicate-type operations.

.*select* using a *Predicates* factory
====
[source,java]
----
MutableList<Integer> myList =...
MutableList<Integer> selected1 = myList.select(Predicates.greaterThan(50));

|*{Predicates}*         |Supports equal, greaterThan, lessThan, in, notIn, and, or, instanceOf, null, notNull, anySatisfy, allSatisfy, etc.
|*{Predicates2}*        |Works with methods suffixed with "With," such as *selectWith*.
|*{StringPredicates}*   |Supports empty, notEmpty, contains, isAlpha, isNumeric, isBlank, startsWith, endsWith, matches, etc.
|*{IntegerPredicates}*  |Supports isEven, isOdd, isPositive, isNegative, isZero.
|*{LongPredicates}*     |Supports isEven, isOdd, isPositive, isNegative, isZero.
|===

== Function

The *{Function}* code block in its most common usage takes each element of a collection as the argument to the code-block logic. It selects an attribute from the element via a "getter" â€” its *valueOf* method. It then returns a computed value or, if no evaluation logic is performed, the attribute itself.

*Function* code blocks are used as a parameter in a variety of common Eclipse Collections methods:

* With the *collect* method to calculate a new value for each element of a given collection, and then return a transformed collection of the same type.
* With the *groupBy* method to generate keys for each nested collection (values) of a new Multimap.
* With the *flatCollect* method, where it must return an *Iterable* that gets "flattened" with other iterables, into a single collection.
* With the *Predicates* factory's *attributeOperator* methods - such as *attributeLessThanOrEqualTo* - to build *Predicate* (boolean) objects.

|*{Function3}*  |Used by *injectIntoWith*; takes the injected argument as the first argument, the current  item of the collection as the second argument,  and the specified parameter for the third argument.

== Procedure

A *{Procedure}* is a code block that performs an evaluation on its single argument and returns nothing. A *Procedure* is most commonly used with _ForEach_ -pattern methods.

=== Count and calculate

[cols=",",]
[%autowidth]
|===
|*{CountProcedure}* |Apply a *Predicate* to an object and increment a count if it returns true.
|*{CounterProcedure}* |Wrap a specified block and keeps track of the number of times it is executed.
|===

=== Control execution

[cols=",",]
[%autowidth]
|===
|*{ChainedProcedure}* |Chain together blocks of code to be executed in sequence; *ChainedProcedure* can chain **Procedure**s, **Function**s or *Function2s*.
|*{CaseProcedure}* |Create an object form of a case statement, which instead of being based on a single switch value is based on a list of discriminator or block combinations. For the first discriminator that returns true for a given value in the case statement, the corresponding block will be executed.
|*{IfProcedure}* |Evaluate the specified block only when a *Predicate* returns true. If the result of evaluating the *Predicate* is false, and the developer has specified that there is an *elseProcedure*, then the elseProcedure is evaluated.
|*{IfProcedureWith}* |Same as *IfProcedure*, but with a second argument passed from the calling iteration method.
|*{ObjectIntProcedure}* |Takes an int as a second argument; this is usually the index of the current element of a collection.
|===

=== Modify collections and maps

[cols=",",]
[%autowidth]
|===
|*{CollectionAddProcedure}* |Add elements to the specified collection when block methods are called.
|*{CollectionRemoveProcedure}* |Remove element from the specified collection when block methods are called.
|*{MapPutProcedure}* |Use a specified *Function* to calculate the key for an object and puts the object into the specified Map at the position of the calculated key.
|*{MultimapPutProcedure}* |Use a specified *Function* to calculate the key for an object and puts the object with the key into the specified *MutableMultimap*.
